Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

* Switching from Python to Java for app development was definitely a challenge. I had to think creatively to adapt to Javaâ€™s more rigid structure and stronger typing compared to Python's flexibility. For example, I found myself having to rethink how I structured parts of the app, especially since concepts like decorators and dynamic typing in Python don't have direct equivalents in Java. One of the biggest hurdles was figuring out how to connect the database and handle user registration, as the tools and libraries in Java were unfamiliar to me at first. Debugging was another struggle because the error messages in Java were more detailed and harder to interpret compared to what I was used to in Python. In the end, I had to break down the process into smaller, more manageable steps, which helped me focus on one problem at a time. While it was tough, this project pushed me to innovate and adapt, and I definitely feel more confident in my ability to switch between languages moving forward.
